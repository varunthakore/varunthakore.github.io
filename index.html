<p>Greetings and Welcome to my webpage !</p>

<p> I'm currently a master's student in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Bombay. My research interests include cryptography and blockchains. </p>

<p> I work with <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva/">Prof. Saravanan Vijayakumaran</a> on using zero-knowledge proofs to develop privacy-preserving proof of reserves protocols for cryptocurrency exchanges. </p>

<p>Please feel free to reach out to me via email to discuss these topics further, ask questions, or simply connect. </p>
